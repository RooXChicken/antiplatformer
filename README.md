# The anti-Platformer

## About
This is a small game I'm working on by myself. It is mainly to learn about game development, but I still hope to turn this into a release at one point or another.

## Content
Right now, it's pretty lacking, but I'm going to work on the story shortly, I just need a good cutscene manager (which is a lot of work to program) so you are gonna have to give me a bit. I already have some story written so far, so once I find a good method for cutscenes, work will begin.

## Compilation/How to compile yourself
### Windows
For windows you need .NetCore 5.0 and any code editor (prefferably vscode because it has the build system set up) then hit F5 (or whatever your IDE uses to compile and run) and there you go.
### Linux
For linux, you will need .NetCore 5.0 development binaries (google it, it's easy to find) and sfml dev binaries, csfml dev binaries, and maybe tgui8 dev binaries (untested). Load it up into an IDE and compile it!

## Contributing
If for some reason you're crazy enough to want to help improve this game, you can make a PR (pull request). You can any coding style if it's small enough (i wil convert the two), but for larger changes I ask you to use my coding style because I don't want to make a bunch of changes to a bunch of changes. Thank you :D

## Support
If there's a problem (there will be trust me) you can make an issue, or ask me on discord here: https://discord.gg/t93abVa . I am always active, so don't be afraid to ask!

## Screenshots/gameplay
Here are some screenshots and videos I reccorded, if you want to watch them.
